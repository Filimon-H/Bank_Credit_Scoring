End-to-End Implementation for Building, Deploying, and Automating a Credit Risk Model

## Credit Scoring Business Understanding

### How does the Basel II Accord's emphasis on risk measurement influence our need for an interpretable and well-documented model?
The Basel II Accord requires financial institutions to rigorously measure and manage credit risk, emphasizing transparency, accountability, and regulatory compliance. This means our credit scoring model must be interpretable and well-documented, allowing stakeholders—including regulators, auditors, and business leaders—to understand how risk is assessed and why decisions are made. Interpretability ensures that risk factors and model outputs can be explained, justified, and audited, which is essential for regulatory approval and for building trust in the model's predictions.

### Since we lack a direct "default" label, why is creating a proxy variable necessary, and what are the potential business risks of making predictions based on this proxy?
In the absence of a direct "default" label, we must engineer a proxy variable—such as one based on customer behavioral patterns (e.g., Recency, Frequency, Monetary value)—to categorize users as high or low risk. This proxy enables us to train and validate our model. However, relying on a proxy introduces risks: if the proxy does not accurately reflect true default behavior, the model may misclassify customers, leading to suboptimal lending decisions, increased defaults, or missed business opportunities. It is crucial to validate the proxy's relevance and monitor model performance over time.

### What are the key trade-offs between using a simple, interpretable model (like Logistic Regression with WoE) versus a complex, high-performance model (like Gradient Boosting) in a regulated financial context?
Simple models like Logistic Regression with Weight of Evidence (WoE) are highly interpretable, making them easier to explain to regulators and stakeholders, and to audit for compliance. However, they may not capture complex patterns in the data, potentially limiting predictive performance. Complex models like Gradient Boosting can achieve higher accuracy by modeling nonlinear relationships, but they are less transparent and harder to interpret. In regulated environments, the trade-off is between maximizing predictive power and ensuring the model is explainable, auditable, and compliant with regulatory standards.
